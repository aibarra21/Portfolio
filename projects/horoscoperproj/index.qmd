### Skills Demonstrated:

**Package Creation, Web Scraping, String Manipulation, Data Frame Creation and Manipulation, Function Design, Looping and Iteration, Package Integration, Error Handling, Documentation and Usability, Efficiency and Best Practices**

## Installation

You can install the development version from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

```{r}
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("aibarra21/horoscoper", force = T)
```

```{r}
library(horoscoper)
```

## Zodiac Sign

You can use the function get_zodiac_sign() to determine what zodiac sign you are by entering your birthday. Enter the month, day, then year in any format.

```{r}
get_zodiac_sign("april 24 2002")
```

You can use the function get_sign_traits() to determine traits and characteristics of your sign.

```{r}
get_sign_traits("taurus")
```

## Daily Horoscope

You can use the function getdailyhoroscope() to get your daily horoscope for your zodiac. This function updates daily.

```{r}
getdailyhoroscope("Taurus")
```

*Code Description for getdailyhoroscope()*

In developing the `getdailyhoroscope` function for the **HoroscopeR** package, I demonstrated a range of R programming skills, including **web scraping**, **data manipulation**, **string processing**, and **function design**. The function retrieves daily horoscopes by scraping data from [Horoscope.com](https://www.horoscope.com/) using the `rvest` package, processes the text with `stringr` to clean and format the output, and dynamically constructs a data frame to store horoscope information for all 12 zodiac signs. Additionally, I implemented error handling to ensure users receive meaningful feedback for invalid inputs. The function is designed to be user-friendly, returning a neatly formatted horoscope message using `glue`, and incorporates best practices such as adding a `Sys.sleep` delay to avoid overloading the server. This project highlights my ability to create practical, efficient, and well-documented R functions for real-world applications.

## Compatibility

You can use the function compatibility() to determine how compatible any two zodiac signs are.

```{r}
compatibility("taurus","Cancer")
```
