### Comparing student understanding of valid and invalid statements of confidence intervals, pre- and post-course

Differences in pedagogical approaches may influence students' ability to grasp these concepts. Simulation-based inference (SBI) curricula, which focus on re-sampling and re-randomization instead of theoretical probability distributions, show a more intuitive understanding than traditional statistical curricula. The research objective is to identify the impact of textbook choice on students' ability to comprehend confidence intervals. The project utilizes a national, multi-institutional dataset that contains pre- and post-measures of students' responses and evaluates their attitudes and conceptual understanding of different statistical concepts
