Both are a great match because they have similar energy levels, dispositions, and desires in life.  They both have an eye for design, protective natures, and a high sex-drive that keeps them interested for a long time.  Taurus and Cancer have a lot in common: both are homebodies, deeply loyal, and very sentimental.  If a Taurus and Cancer went to the movies on their first date, they would each save the ticket stub as a keepsake (and possibly put it in a scrapbook).  Taurus and Cancer both crave stability and security in life.  They want to build a happy home, settle down, and have a family.  They both just want to be loved."
